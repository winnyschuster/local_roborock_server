# Tested Vacuums

Check this page alongside [Installation](installation.md) and [Onboarding](onboarding.md) if you are trying to confirm whether your model is expected to work.

For most users, start with ZeroSSL. Actalis is mainly recommended for older vacuums or for models that already have reports showing better compatibility with the Actalis chain. Some newer vacuums can also handle any cert you throw at it!

## Buying a New Vacuum?

If you're looking to buy a Roborock, consider using one of my affiliate links on the [Support This Project](support.md) page. It doesn't cost you anything extra and helps keep this project going!

## Unsupported Vacuums

The following vacuums are not supported and may never be supported.

- Roborock Q10 X5 / X5+
- Roborock Q7 M5 / M5+
- Roborock Q7 L5
- Roborock Q10 s5/ s5+

These vacuums likely all use a newer firmware version that uses a v2 of the region endpoint. In order to support them, we need to get a firmware dump. If you would like to disassemble your vac, we can likely get this. Please reach out.

- Roborock Saros 20 Sonic
- Roborock Qrevo Curv 2 Pro
- Saros 20

## Potentially Supported
These are (maybe) using the same firmware as the two above. Any vacuum released after Sep 2025 is likely not supported in its current form.  Please give it a try and let me know so I can update the docs.

- Roborock Qrevo Edge 2
- Roborock Qrevo S Pro
- Qrevo Curv 2 Flow
- Qrevo CurvX
- Saros Z70

## Unlisted Vacuums

If your model is not listed, start with ZeroSSL unless it is an older model that is likely to need a different trusted chain. If onboarding fails after the DNS and server checks pass, try Actalis or a provided certificate and report the result.
